The pineapple-shaped fruits are borne on female trees whereas the spikes of fragrant, pollenbearing flowers are borne separately on male trees. Many uses: leaves (lau hala) for mats, baskets, hats; the yellow to red fruit sections for leis, brushes; male flowers to scent tapa, their leaflike bracts to plait mats (see hīnano). (Neal 51) The aerial root (uleule) tip is a good source of vitamin B and cooked in ti leaves was used medicinally, although unpleasant tasting. The tree is called pū hala.

Persons swore oaths by this and other kānāwai.

Kū (upright) represented male generating power, and Hina (prostrate) was the expression of female fecundity and the power of growth. Kū also refers to the rising sun, and Hina to the setting sun; hence their realm includes the whole earth and the heavens and all generations of man born and unborn. (HM 12-13). Many fictional characters are named Kū and Hina, with implication of high birth, and most of the few references to infanticide in the stories refer to Kū and Hina, possibly indicating that it occurred rarely and that the motive was racial purity. Dozens of epithets are associated with Kū. Various forms of Kū were appealed to for rain and growth, fishing, and sorcery, but he is best known as a god of war.
