The pineapple-shaped fruits are borne on female trees whereas the spikes of fragrant, pollenbearing flowers are borne separately on male trees. Many uses: leaves (lau hala) for mats, baskets, hats; the yellow to red fruit sections for leis, brushes; male flowers to scent tapa, their leaflike bracts to plait mats (see hīnano).

In prayers to Kāne (HM 53-55) his name is followed by more than seventy epithets. Kanaloa was his constant companion, but Kāne's name always preceded. Twelve sacred paradisic islands lay off the Hawaiian group "within easy reach," visible on the distant horizon at sunrise and sunset. One is Kāne-hūnā-moku (Kāne hidden island) where Kāne and Kanaloa lived.

Since some early laws concerned water (wai) rights, some have suggested that the word kānāwai is derived from wai, water; this seems doubtful in view of the many ancient edicts of gods that have no relation to water (also cf. wai₄ and derivatives). Perhaps the most famous kānāwai is the kānāwai kaiʻokia promulgated by the god Kāne after the flood of Kahinaliʻi, promising that ever afterwards the sea would be separated (ʻokia) from the land (i.e., not encroach on the land). Persons swore oaths by this and other kānāwai. The kānāwai of Kū was that no one might lean backwards (kīkiʻi) during ceremonies; that of Kūkauakahi that no one might bend forward (kūpou); that of Kānehekili, that no one might whisper (hāwanawana) during ceremonies; that of Kahōaliʻi, that the white kaʻupu bird (kaʻupu kea) must be used as his symbol during the makahiki. see below and (Kam. 64:13–17) and note 9.penal code. lit., laws for punishing crime.revised statute.notes on the scale....perhaps the most famous kānāwai, promulgated by the god Kāne after the flood of Kahinaliʻi, promising that ever afterwards the sea would be separated (ʻokia) from the land (i.e., not encroach on the land).

Prayers connected with this major god include Kūkoliʻi, Kūlawa, Kūlewalewa, Kūpapaʻa, Kūwā, Kūwī... 
In some accounts, Kū and Hina were the first gods to reach Hawaii, and were followed next by Kāne and Kanaloa, and last by Lono (HM 11). Kū (upright) represented male generating power, and Hina (prostrate) was the expression of female fecundity and the power of growth. Kū also refers to the rising sun, and Hina to the setting sun; hence their realm includes the whole earth and the heavens and all generations of man born and unborn. (HM 12-13). Many fictional characters are named Kū and Hina, with implication of high birth, and most of the few references to infanticide in the stories refer to Kū and Hina, possibly indicating that it occurred rarely and that the motive was racial purity. Dozens of epithets are associated with Kū. Various forms of Kū were appealed to for rain and growth, fishing, and sorcery, but he is best known as a god of war. When gathering medicine with their right hands, people prayed to Kū for success. The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth nights of the lunar month were sacred to Kū.
