# Hawaiian-Word-List
Scraped automatically from the valuable resource https://www.trussel2.com/HAW/ because I could not find a way to download it in a parseable way otherwise.

I can't guarantee it's perfect. Open a PR if you find an issue and can fix it.

## Output
See [hawaiian-words.csv](`hawaiian-words.csv`)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Get `bun` (https://bun.io/)
3. Run `bun install`
4. Run `bun run scrape.ts`
5. Output is in [hawaiian-words.csv](`hawaiian-words.csv`)
