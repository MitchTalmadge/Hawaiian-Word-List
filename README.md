# Hawaiian Word List
Scraped automatically from the amazing [Combined Hawaiian Dictionary](https://www.trussel2.com/HAW/) created by the late [Stephen (Kepano) Trussel](https://www.trussel2.com/), who passed away on June 26, 2020. I could not find a way to download it in an organized, machine-parseable way, and I wanted to preserve it in case it ever goes offline.

I can't guarantee the data is perfect or complete. Open a PR if you want to contribute!
