In some accounts, Kū and Hina were the first gods to reach Hawaii, and were followed next by Kāne and Kanaloa, and last by Lono (HM 11). Kū (upright) represented male generating power, and Hina (prostrate) was the expression of female fecundity and the power of growth. Kū also refers to the rising sun, and Hina to the setting sun; hence their realm includes the whole earth and the heavens and all generations of man born and unborn. (HM 12-13). Many fictional characters are named Kū and Hina, with implication of high birth, and most of the few references to infanticide in the stories refer to Kū and Hina, possibly indicating that it occurred rarely and that the motive was racial purity. Dozens of epithets are associated with Kū. Various forms of Kū were appealed to for rain and growth, fishing, and sorcery, but he is best known as a god of war. When gathering medicine with their right hands, people prayed to Kū for success. The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth nights of the lunar month were sacred to Kū.
